ABC Company Employee Dataset Analysis

Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the ABC Company's employee dataset, which contains 458 rows and 9 columns. The dataset encompasses various details about employees, such as team affiliation, position, height, age, and salary. The primary goal of the project is to preprocess the data, perform in-depth analysis, and visualize the findings to derive meaningful insights about the workforce.



Preprocessing

The dataset preprocessing step ensures data consistency and integrity before analysis. Specifically:

The "height" column was corrected by replacing the existing values with random numbers uniformly distributed between 150 and 180 cm.

Data validation checks were performed to ensure there were no missing or inconsistent entries in other columns.



Analysis Tasks

Team Distribution and Percentage Split

The distribution of employees across each team was determined.

Percentage splits were calculated to understand the proportion of employees in each team relative to the total workforce.


Employee Position Segregation

Employees were categorized based on their job positions within the company, identifying trends in the workforce structure.


Predominant Age Group

The most common age group among employees was identified to understand workforce demographics.


Highest Salary Expenditure

Teams and positions with the highest total salary expenditures were pinpointed, revealing areas of significant financial investment.


Correlation Between Age and Salary

An investigation into the relationship between employee age and salary was conducted using statistical and graphical methods.




Graphical Representation

For effective communication of findings, the following visualizations were created:

Bar Chart: Distribution of employees across teams with percentage labels.

Pie Chart: Breakdown of employee positions by category.

Histogram: Age distribution to highlight the predominant age group.

Stacked Bar Chart: Salary expenditure by team and position.

Scatter Plot: Visualization of the correlation between age and salary.








Insights Gained

The analysis revealed the most and least populated teams, providing a clear view of workforce distribution.

Key trends in job positions and their prevalence were identified.

The predominant age group highlighted the company's overall demographic profile.

Financial insights regarding salary distribution across teams and positions shed light on budget allocation.

A correlation (or lack thereof) between age and salary was discovered, offering a deeper understanding of salary dynamics within the company.







Additional Information

Tools Used: Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy) for data manipulation and visualization.

Dataset Integrity: Preprocessing ensured all data used for analysis was clean and accurate.

Submission Deadline: The project was completed and submitted within the stipulated timeline.

This project demonstrates proficiency in data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization, as well as the ability to extract and communicate actionable insights from real-world data.
